# workday_scheduler

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

For the purpose of this assignment, I will utilize Moment.js to work with dates and times.

When opened, the planner should open to the current day.

When you scroll down, you will be presented with time blocks for standard business hours that day.

Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is the past, present, or future.

When you click a time block, you can enter an event.

When you click the "save" button for that time block, that event is saved for local storage.
